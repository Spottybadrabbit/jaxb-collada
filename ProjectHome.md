This project enables loading 3D models into NASA World Wind Java. This project aims to fill the gap that exists because WWJ doesn't yet (as of 2011) natively support 3D model loading. This project will help load the following model types:
  * COLLADA (https://collada.org) models, using the Ardor3D engine (http://ardor3d.com/)
  * 3ds Max (http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/)
  * Wavefront OBJ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)
